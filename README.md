<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

> Othello is a board game involving abstract strategy and played by two players on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of distinct pieces for each side. Pieces typically are disks with a light and a dark face, each side belonging to one player. The player's goal is to have a majority of their colored pieces showing at the end of the game, turning over as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.

This project is an improved version of a previous project called ReversIA, which was a first step into learning IA while implementing one of my childhood games.

Due to previous limitations, I chose to recreate my program using Python while improving code documentation and optimization.

The [rules](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english) of Othello (also called Reversi) are simple to understand, and if you have never tried it, you really should give it a go. However, it has this reputation of being *"easy to learn, hard to master"*, which seemed like a good idea to create an AI to play against.
